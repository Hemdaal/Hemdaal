Decision Logs:
1. Decided to go with custo widgets and metrics(Not to be using a generic metric data)
    Reason: 1. Not all metrics can be fetched in this approach as some of the metric needs complex SQL queries.
            2. We cannot make the dashboard widget to perform actions such as promote/deploy.
